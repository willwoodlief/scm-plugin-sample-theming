 * This plugin uses the https://github.com/spatie/laravel-package-tools library to make the boilerplate laravel for a new service. It is optional, but makes it simpler. But regardless, the plugin needs to extend the Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider class
 *
 * This class is found by the framework in the composer.json extra.providers field
 *
 * In this example class, I only need to override two methods configurePackage(), and packageBooted().
 *
 * In the configurePackage() I use the laravel-package-tools to register new blade views, new routes,commands, facades, assets, migrations.
 * The routes will load in the controllers used for the routes
 *
 * In a laravel package that uses its own views, these views are always prefixed. See the constant I made called VIEW_BLADE_ROOT and how its used in the other files
 *
 * Note that we can organize the resources however we need in resources/dist and the blades however we see fit at resources/views
